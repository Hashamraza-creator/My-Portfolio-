  <h1>My skills</h1>
  <h2>Full Stack Development</h2>
<p>As a software engineer from Multan, I bring a comprehensive Skill set in full-stack development, enabling me to handle both front-end and back-end tasks with proficiency. My expertise includes:

  In front-end technologies, I excel in crafting well-structured and visually appealing web pages using HTML and CSS. I also implement interactive features and dynamic content with JavaScript, and have experience with frameworks like React.js. My approach to responsive design ensures seamless user experiences across various devices and screen sizes.
  
  On the back-end side, I build scalable server-side applications with Node.js and develop RESTful APIs with Express.js for efficient data management. I am proficient in working with both SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB) databases, ensuring robust data storage and retrieval.
  
  I also have experience with version control using Git and GitHub, and am familiar with deployment tools and cloud platforms such as Heroku, AWS, and Docker for reliable application deployment and scaling.</p>

   <h2>iOS Development</h2>
<p>In addition to full-stack development, I specialize in iOS development, creating intuitive and high-performance mobile applications for Apple devices. I develop iOS applications using Swift, focusing on clean, maintainable code and leveraging the latest features of the language.

  I design user interfaces with UIKit and SwiftUI, providing engaging and responsive app experiences. My expertise includes implementing local data storage with Core Data and integrating cloud services for data synchronization and remote functionality. I also prepare and submit applications to the App Store, ensuring compliance with Apple's guidelines and optimizing for performance and user experience.
  
  Combining these skills allows me to build end-to-end solutions that deliver both powerful web and mobile applications. My background in software engineering and my commitment to staying current with industry trends ensure that I can tackle diverse development challenges with confidence. </p>

<h2>UI/UX Design</h2>
<p>
  My skills in UI/UX design focus on creating user-friendly and visually appealing interfaces for both web and mobile applications. I am proficient in:

Designing intuitive user interfaces that enhance user experience and ensure ease of navigation. I use tools like Figma, Adobe XD, and Sketch to create wireframes, prototypes, and high-fidelity designs.

Conducting user research and usability testing to gather insights and refine designs based on user feedback. I aim to create designs that are not only aesthetically pleasing but also functional and accessible.

Applying best practices in user experience design to ensure that applications are both engaging and easy to use. My design approach balances form and function, striving to meet the needs and preferences of the target audience.

Combining these skills allows me to build end-to-end solutions that deliver powerful and user-centric web and mobile applications. My background in software engineering and commitment to staying current with industry trends ensure that I tackle diverse development and design challenges with confidence.
